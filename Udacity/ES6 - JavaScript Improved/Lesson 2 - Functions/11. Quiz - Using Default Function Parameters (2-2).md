## 11. Quiz: Using Default Function Parameters (2-2)

#### Directions:

Create a `buildHouse()` function that accepts an object as a default parmeters. The object should set the following properties to these default values:
  * `floors = 1`
  * `color = 'red'`
  * `walls = 'brick'`
The function should return the following if no arguments or any empty object is passed to the function.
`Your house has 1 floor(s) whith red brick walls.`

**The Start Code:**
```javascript
// your code goes here

/* tests
console.log(buildHouse()); // Your house has 1 floor(s) with red brick walls.
console.log(buildHouse({})); // Your house has 1 floor(s) with red brick walls.
console.log(buildHouse({floors: 3, color: 'yellow'})); // Your house has 3 floor(s) with yellow brick walls.
*/
```

#### My Solution
```javascript
function buildHouse({floors = '1', color = 'red', walls = 'brick'} = {}){
    return `Your house has ${floors} floor(s) with ${color} ${walls} walls.`;
}

console.log(buildHouse()); // Your house has 1 floor(s) with red brick walls.
console.log(buildHouse({})); // Your house has 1 floor(s) with red brick walls.
console.log(buildHouse({floors: 3, color: 'yellow'})); // Your house has 3 floor(s) with yellow brick walls.
```
