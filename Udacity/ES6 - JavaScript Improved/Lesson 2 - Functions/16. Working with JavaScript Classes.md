## 16. Working with JavaScript Classes

```javascript
class Plane {
  constructor(numEngines) {
    this.numEngines = numEngines;
    this.enginesActive = false;
  }

  static badWeather(planes) {
    for (plane of planes) {
      plane.enginesActive = false;
    }
  }

  startEngines() {
    console.log('starting enginesâ€¦');
    this.enginesActive = true;
  }
}
```

**NOTE**
* Class is just a function (class is a mirage over prototypal inheritance)
* Commas are not used to separate properties or methods in a Class
* Using classes requires the use of new
* See how `badWeather()` has the word `static` in front of it while `startEngines()` doesn't? That makes `badWeather()` a method that's accessed directly on the `Plane` class, so you can call it like this:
    ```javascript
  * Plane.badWeather([plane1, plane2, plane3]);
  ```
