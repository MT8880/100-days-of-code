## 5. Sets

If you think back to mathematics, **a set is a collection of distinct items**. For example, `{2, 4, 5, 6}` is a set because each number is unique and appears only once. However, `{1, 1, 2, 4}` is *not* a set because it *contains duplicate entries* (the 1 is in there more than once!).

In ES6, there’s a new built-in object that behaves like a mathematical set and works similarly to an array. This new object is conveniently called a **"Set"**. The biggest differences between a set and an array are:
  * Sets are not indexed-based - you do not refer to items in a set based on their position in the set
  * items in a Set can’t be accessed individually

Basically, a Set is an object that lets you store unique items. You can add items to a Set, remove items from a Set, and loop over a Set. These items can be either primitive values or objects.

**How to Create a Set**

This creates an empty Set games with no items.
```javascript
const games = new Set();
```

If you want to create a Set from a list of values, you use an array:
```javascript
const games = new Set(['Super Mario Bros.', 'Banjo-Kazooie', 'Mario Kart', 'Super Mario Bros.']);
```
