## 7. Sets & Iterators

The last step to working with Sets is looping over them.

If you remember back to our discussion on the new `iterable` and `iterator protocols` in ES6, then you’ll recall that Sets are built-in iterables. This means two things in terms of looping:

1. You can use the Set’s **default iterator** to step through each item in a Set, one by one.
  ```javascript
  const iterator = months.values();
  iterator.next();
  iterator.next();
  ```
2. You can use the new **for...of** loop to loop through each item in a Set.
  ```javascript
  const colors = new Set(['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'violet', 'brown', 'black']);
  for (const color of colors) {
    console.log(color);
  }
  ```
