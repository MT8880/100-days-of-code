## 10. WeakSets

A **WeakSet** is just like a normal Set with a few key differences:
1. a WeakSet can **only contain objects**
2. a WeakSet **is not iterable** which means it can’t be looped over
3. a WeakSet does **not have a .clear()** method

You can create a WeakSet just like you would a normal Set, except that you use the `WeakSet` constructor.

```javascript
const student1 = { name: 'James', age: 26, gender: 'male' };
const student2 = { name: 'Julia', age: 27, gender: 'female' };
const student3 = { name: 'Richard', age: 31, gender: 'male' };

const roster = new WeakSet([student1, student2, student3]);
```

 If you set an object to `null`, then you’re essentially deleting the object. And when JavaScript’s **garbage collector** runs, the memory that object previously occupied will be freed up to be used later in your program.
