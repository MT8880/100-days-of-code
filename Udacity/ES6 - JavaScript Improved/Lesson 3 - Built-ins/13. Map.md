## 13. Map

If Sets are similar to Arrays, then Maps are similar to Objects because Maps store key-value pairs similar to how objects contain named properties with values.

Essentially, **a Map is an object that lets you store key-value pairs** where both the keys and the values can be objects, primitive values, or a combination of the two.

### How to Create a Map
```javascript
const employees = new Map();
```

### Modifyng Maps

To add key-valuse pairs use **.set()** method.

```javascript
const employees = new Map();

employees.set(`james.parkes@audacity.com`, {
  firstName: `James`,
  lastName: `Parkes`,
  role: `Content Developer`
});
employees.set(`julia@audacity.com`, {
  firstName: `Julia`,
  lastName: `Van Cleve`,
  role: `Content Developer`
});
employees.set(`richard@audacity.com`, {
  firstName: `Richard`,
  lastName: `Kalehoff`,
  role: `Content Developer`
});
```

`Note` The **.set()** method takes two arguments:
  1. key: is used to reference the second argument
  2. value

To remove key-value pairs use **.delete()** method

```javascript
employees.delete(`julia@udacity.com`);
employees.delete(`richard@udacity.com`);
```

You can use the **.clear()** method to remove all key-value pairs from the Map.

```javascript
employees.clear();
```

**Note:** the `.delete()` method returns `true` if a key-value pairs is successfully deleted from the `Map` object, and `false` if unsuccessful. The return value of `.set()`is the `Map` object itself if successful.

### Working with Maps

You can use the **.has()** method to check if a key-value pair exists in your Map by passing it a key.

```javascript
const members = new Map();
members.set(`Evelyn`, 78.60);
members.set(`Liam`,20.16);
members.set(`Sophia`, 0);
members.set(`Marcus`, 10.25);

console.log(members.has(`Xavier`)); // false
console.log(members.has(`Marcus`)); // true
```

You can retrieve value from a Map by passing a key to the **.get()** method.

```javascript
console.log(members.get(`Evelyn`)); // 78.60
```
### Looping Through Maps

You've got three different options to choose from:
  1. Step through each key or value using the Map's default **iterator**
  ```javascript
  let iteratorObjForKeys = members.keys();
  iteratorObjForKeys.next();
  ```
  2. Loop through each key-value pair using the new **for...of** loop
  ```javascript
  for (const member of members) {
      console.log(member);
  }
  ```
  However, when you use a `for...of` loop with a Map, you donâ€™t exactly get back a key or a value. Instead, the key-value pair is split up into an array where the first element is the key and the second element is the value. If only there were a way to fix this?
  ```javascript
  for (const member of members) {
    console.log([key, value] = member);
  }
  ```
  3. Loop through each key-value pair using the Map's **.forEach()** method
  ```javascript
  members.forEach((key, value) => console.log(key, value));
  ```
