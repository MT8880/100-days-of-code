## 16. WeakMap

A WeakMap is just like a normal Map with a few key differences:

1. a WeakMap can only contain objects as keys,
2. a WeakMap is not iterable which means it can’t be looped and
3. a WeakMap does not have a `.clear()` method.

You can create a WeakMap just like you would a normal Map, except that you use the **WeakMap constructor**.

```javascript
const book1 = { title: 'Pride and Prejudice', author: 'Jane Austen' };
const book2 = { title: 'The Catcher in the Rye', author: 'J.D. Salinger' };
const book3 = { title: 'Gulliver’s Travels', author: 'Jonathan Swift' };

const library = new WeakMap();
library.set(book1, true);
library.set(book2, false);
library.set(book3, true);

// garbage collection
book1 = null;
console.log(library);
```
