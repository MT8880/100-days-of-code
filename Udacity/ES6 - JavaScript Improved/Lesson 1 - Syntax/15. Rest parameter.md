## 15. Rest parameter

The **rest parameter**, also written with three consecutive dots ( `...` ), allows you to represent an indefinite number of elements as an array. This can be helpful in a couple of different situations.

One situation is when assigning the values of an array to variables. For example,
```javascript
const order = [20.17, 18.67, 1.50, "cheese", "eggs", "milk", "bread"];
const [total, subtotal, tax, ...items] = order;
console.log(total, subtotal, tax, items);
```

Prints:
```
20.17 18.67 1.5 ["cheese", "eggs", "milk", "bread"]
```
This code takes the values of the `order` array and assigns them to individual variables using **destructuring**. `total`, `subtotal`, and `tax` are assigned the first three values in the array, however, `items` is where you want to pay the most attention.

By using the rest parameter, `items` is assigned the rest of the values in the array (as an array).

#### Variadic functions

Another use case for the rest parameter is when youâ€™re working with variadic functions. **Variadic functions** are functions that take an indefinite number of arguments.

```javascript
function sum(...nums) {
  let total = 0;  
  for(const num of nums) {
    total += num;
  }
  return total;
}
```
