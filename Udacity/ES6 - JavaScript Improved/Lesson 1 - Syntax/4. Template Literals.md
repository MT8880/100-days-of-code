## 4. Template Literals

Template literals are essentially **string literals that include embedded expressions**.

Denoted with **backticks** ( `` ) (**alt96**) instead of single quotes ( '' ) or double quotes ( "" ), template literals can contain placeholders which are represented using **${expression}**. This makes it much easier to build strings.

Here's the previous examples using template literals.
```javascript
let message = `${student.name} please see ${teacher.name} in ${teacher.room} to pick up your report card.`;
```
