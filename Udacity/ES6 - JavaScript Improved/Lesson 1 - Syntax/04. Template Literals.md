## 4. Template Literals

Template literals are essentially **string literals that include embedded expressions**.

Denoted with **backticks** ( `` ) (**alt96**) instead of single quotes ( '' ) or double quotes ( "" ), template literals can contain placeholders which are represented using **${expression}**. This makes it much easier to build strings.

Here's the previous examples using template literals.
```javascript
let message = `${student.name} please see ${teacher.name} in ${teacher.room} to pick up your report card.`;
```

#### QUIZ

**Instructions**: Change the `greeting` string to use a template literal.
```javascript
const myName = '[NAME]';
const greeting = 'Hello, my name is ' + myName;
console.log(greeting);
```

#### My Solution

```javascript
const myName = 'Samuele';
const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${myName}`;
console.log(greeting);
```

**TIP**: Embedded expressions inside template literals can do more than just reference variables. You can perform operations, call functions and use loops inside embedded expressions!
