## 14. Spread... Operator

The **spread operator**, written with three consecutive dots ( `...` ), is new in ES6 and gives you the ability to expand, or spread, iterable objects into multiple elements.

Letâ€™s take a look at a few examples to see how it works.
```javascript
const books = ["Don Quixote", "The Hobbit", "Alice in Wonderland", "Tale of Two Cities"];
console.log(...books);
```

Prints:
```
Don Quixote The Hobbit Alice in Wonderland Tale of Two Cities
```

#### QUIZ

Instructions: Use the spread operator to combine the `fruits` and `vegetables` arrays into the `produce` array.

**The Start Code:**
```javascript
const fruits = ["apples", "bananas", "pears"];
const vegetables = ["corn", "potatoes", "carrots"];

const produce = [];

console.log(produce);
```
#### My Solution
```javascript
const fruits = ["apples", "bananas", "pears"];
const vegetables = ["corn", "potatoes", "carrots"];

const produce = [...fruits, ...vegetables];

console.log(produce);
```
