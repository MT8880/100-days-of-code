## 7. Using Polyfills

**What is a polyfill?**

> A polyfill, or polyfiller, is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively.

**An example polyfill**

The code below is a polyfill for the new ES6 String method, startsWith():
```javascript
if (!String.prototype.startsWith) {
  String.prototype.startsWith = function (searchString, position) {
    position = position || 0;
    return this.substr(position, searchString.length) === searchString;
  };
}
```
Why does the startsWith() polyfill begin with the following line?

```javascript
if (!String.prototype.startsWith)
```
`Answer` **It avoids overwriting the native `startsWith` method**.

Remember that a polyfill is used to patch missing functionality. If the browser supports ES6 and has the native `startsWith` method, then there's no reason to polyfill it. If this check didn't exist, then this polyfill would overwrite the native implementation.

#### Polyfills aren't only for patching missing JavaScript features

JavaScript is the language used to create a polyfill, but a polyfill doesn't just patch up missing JavaScript features! There are polyfills for all sorts of browser features:

  - SVG
  - Canvas
  - Web Storage (local storage / session storage)
  - Video
  - HTML5 elements
  - Accessibility
  - Web Sockets
  - and many more!
