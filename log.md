### R1D1: January 4, 2018

First day: I started a FreeCodeCamep's project (Advanced Front End Development Project): **[Build a Tic Tac Toe Game](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game)**.
I made the html and css and started the JS.
I decided not to worry about the goodlooking graphic; I want to focus on JavaScript, first.
