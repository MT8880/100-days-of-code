### R1D1: January 4, 2018 (1h)

First day: I started a FreeCodeCamep's project (Advanced Front End Development Project): **[Build a Tic Tac Toe Game](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game)**.
I made the html and css and started the JS.
I decided not to worry about the goodlooking graphic; I want to focus on JavaScript, first.

### R2D2: January 5, 2018 (2.5h)

Second day: I continued with the Tic Tac Toe Game. I made the main functions:
* **draw** the symbol x and o
* a simple Artificial ~~Stupidity~~ Intelligence to place the **PC'symbol**
* place the **player's symbol** in the board with a click
* choose whether want to play (**x** or **o**)
