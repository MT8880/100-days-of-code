### R1D1: January 4, 2018 (1h)

`First day` I started a FreeCodeCamep's project (Advanced Front End Development Project): **[Build a Tic Tac Toe Game](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game)**.
I made the html and css and started the JS.
I decided not to worry about the goodlooking graphic; I want to focus on JavaScript, first.

### R1D2: January 5, 2018 (2.5h)

`Second day` I continued with the Tic Tac Toe Game. I made the main functions:
* **draw** the symbol x and o
* a simple Artificial ~~Stupidity~~ Intelligence to place the **PC'symbol**
* place the **player's symbol** in the board with a click
* choose whether want to play (**x** or **o**)

### R1D3: January 6, 2018 (1.5h)

`Third day` **I finished the Tic Tac Toe Game**. Hurray! :smiley::smiley::smiley:

The user stories:
1. I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
2. My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
3. I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

The style is very simple and essential; I think It's my cup of tea :tea:!

### R1D4: January 7, 2018 (2.5h)

`4th day` I start to work to a new FreeCodeCamp's challenge: **Build a Simon Game**.

I've created the user interface and a basic shape for the game.

`5th day` :smiley: I finished the **Simon Game** and I claimed my first **FreeCodeCamp certification**: [View My Front End Development Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/el3um4s/front-end-certification)

### R1D6: January 9, 2018 (2h)

`6th day` This was a productive day! I started the Udacity [**ES6** - JavaScript Improved course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/es6-javascript-improved--ud356). I'm **learning a lot of things**:
* Let and Const
* Template Literals
* Destructuring
* For...of Loop
* Spread... Operator
* ...Rest parameter

I also created a new folder in my GitHub repository: it's dedicated to this course ([link](https://github.com/el3um4s/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Udacity/ES6%20-%20JavaScript%20Improved)). I discovered **Markdown** syntax: I love this!

### R1D7: January 10, 2018 (1h)

`7th day` I started the 2nd lesson: the Functions. It's interesting; I love **Arrow Functions**. But I have problems with *"this"*.
I also worked on a layout for my italian keyboard on Windows. Now I can write backtick with **AltGr + '**

### R1D8: January 11, 2018 (2h)

`8th day` I'm testing [**GitKraken for Windows and Linux**](https://www.gitkraken.com/): I really need to know more about GitHub. Maybe one of my next courses will be related with this. Also, I had uninstalled Brackets (it's going too slow after the last update) and installed [**Atom**](https://atom.io/).

About Javascript: I finished the 2nd lesson: **The functions**. I repeated the **this** section; then I did **Default Function Parameters** and **JavaScript Classes**.

### R1D9: January 12, 2018 (2h)

`9th day` Hard day: the computer I use for my job is dying. Maybe I have to buy another one.
I studied only two sections of [**Lesson 3 - Built-ins**](https://github.com/el3um4s/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Udacity/ES6%20-%20JavaScript%20Improved/Lesson%203%20-%20Built-ins):

  * Symbols
  * Iteration & Iterable Protocols

I think this lesson it's diffucult. I didn't understand **[Symbol.iterator]**, tomorrow I'm going to revise it.

### R1D10: January 13, 2018 (2h)

`10th day` I love **Maps**, I don't understand **Promises**, I think **Proxies** are very interesting and **Generators** are powerful. I need to make practice: ES6 is great but I have no experience.
I added to my `To Do List` the Udacity course about *JavaScript Promises*.

  * [JavaScript Promises](https://eu.udacity.com/course/javascript-promises--ud898)


### R1D11: January 14, 2018 (1h)

`11th day` I **finished** the Udacity [**ES6** - JavaScript Improved course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/es6-javascript-improved--ud356): Hurray!


### R1D12: January 16, 2018 (4h)

`12th day` Yesterday I was sick so I didn't do anything. Today I didn't go to work and I stayed at home. I studied a lot of things:

  1. Markdown
  2. Basic of GitHub
  3. Electron's History

I started a new Udemy Course: [Electron for Desktop Apps](https://www.udemy.com/electron-react-tutorial/) by Stephen Grider ([@ste_grider](https://twitter.com/ste_grider)) I opened a new Git to track my progress in the first project: [electron-videoinfo](https://github.com/el3um4s/electron-videoinfo).


### R1D13: January 17, 2018 (1h)

`13th dat` Today I watched the first part of the course about Electron.

### R1D14: January 18, 2018 (2h)

`14th day` Oggi ho finito la parte in HTML e JS dell'app VideoInfo. Domani dovrò sistemare la parte grafica. Penso di aver capito abbastanza bene il concetto base per fare comunicare _MainWindow_ ed _Electron App_. 

### R1D15: January 19, 2018 (3h)

`15th day`Ho finito la parte grafica dell'app VideoInfo. Il codice HTML non è elegante ma per il momento può bastare. Ho poi provato a creare un eseguibile per Window ma dopo un'ora di tentativi non sono riuscito a fare nulla.


### R1D16: January 20, 2018 (4h)

`16th day` Finito il progetto **Video Info**. Ho creato un file eseguibile (portable) per Windows (64bit) e un installer per Linux (deb a 64bit). Inoltre ho aggiornato il repository GitHub completando il file [README](https://github.com/el3um4s/electron-videoinfo/blob/master/README.md) aggiungendo un'immagine dell'app in esecuzione.
