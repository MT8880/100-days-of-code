### R1D1: January 4, 2018 (1h)

First day: I started a FreeCodeCamep's project (Advanced Front End Development Project): **[Build a Tic Tac Toe Game](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game)**.
I made the html and css and started the JS.
I decided not to worry about the goodlooking graphic; I want to focus on JavaScript, first.

### R1D2: January 5, 2018 (2.5h)

Second day: I continued with the Tic Tac Toe Game. I made the main functions:
* **draw** the symbol x and o
* a simple Artificial ~~Stupidity~~ Intelligence to place the **PC'symbol**
* place the **player's symbol** in the board with a click
* choose whether want to play (**x** or **o**)

### R1D3: January 6, 2018 (1.5h)

Third day: **I finished the Tic Tac Toe Game**. Hurray! :smiley::smiley::smiley:

The user stories:
1. I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
2. My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
3. I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

The style is very simple and essential; I think It's my cup of tea :tea:!

### R1D6: January 9, 2018 (2h)

6th day: This was a productive day! I started the Udacity [**ES6** - JavaScript Improved course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/es6-javascript-improved--ud356). I'm **learning a lot of things**:
* Let and Const
* Template Literals
* Destructuring
* For...of Loop
* Spread... Operator
* ...Rest parameter

I also created a new folder in my GitHub repository: it's dedicated to this course ([link](https://github.com/el3um4s/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Udacity/ES6%20-%20JavaScript%20Improved)). I discovered **Markdown** syntax: I love this!

### R1D7: January 10, 2018 (1h)

7th day: I started the 2nd lesson: the Functions. It's interesting; I love **Arrow Functions**. But I have problems with *"this"*.
I also worked on a layout for my italian keyboard on windows. Now I can write backtick with **AltGr + '**
