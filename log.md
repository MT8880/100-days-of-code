### R1D1: January 4, 2018 (1h)

First day: I started a FreeCodeCamep's project (Advanced Front End Development Project): **[Build a Tic Tac Toe Game](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game)**.
I made the html and css and started the JS.
I decided not to worry about the goodlooking graphic; I want to focus on JavaScript, first.

### R1D2: January 5, 2018 (2.5h)

Second day: I continued with the Tic Tac Toe Game. I made the main functions:
* **draw** the symbol x and o
* a simple Artificial ~~Stupidity~~ Intelligence to place the **PC'symbol**
* place the **player's symbol** in the board with a click
* choose whether want to play (**x** or **o**)

### R1D3: January 6, 2018 (1.5h)

Third day: **I finished the Tic Tac Toe Game**. Hurray! :smiley::smiley::smiley:

The user stories:
1. I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
2. My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
3. I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

The style is very simple and essential; I think It's my cup of tea :tea:!

### R1D4: January 7, 2018

4th day: I start to work to a new FreeCodeCamp's challenge: **Build a Simon Game**.

#### Simon Game

* **Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE.
* Fulfill the below **user stories**. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
  1. I am presented with a random series of button presses.
  2. Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
  3. I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
  4. If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
  5. I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
  6. If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
  7. I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
  8. I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
* **Hint**: Here are mp3s you can use for each button:
